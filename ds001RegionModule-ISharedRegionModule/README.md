ExampleRegionModule
===================

Example region module for OpenSimulator

Clone this repo into your ./addon-modules directory and
run the prebiuld script. The module needs an ini entry:

https://github.com/BlueWall/ExampleSharedRegionModule/blob/master/Src/ExampleModule.cs#L145


The example region module for OpenSimulator includes heavy comments to explain 
various parts of creating a working module for OpenSimulator. Logging includes
sequence numbers to show the order of calls during module loading. 

The prebuild.xml file is important too and includes commenting to guide development
of new modules.

If you encounter issues with the example module, please file an issue report here then
look me up in #opensim-dev on freenode.net.

Thanks for using it,
BlueWall
